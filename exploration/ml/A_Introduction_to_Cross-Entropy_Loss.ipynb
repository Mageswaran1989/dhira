    "When we develop a model for probabilistic classification, we aim to map the model's inputs to probabilistic *predictions*, and we often *train* our model by incrementally adjusting the model's parameters so that our predictions get closer and closer to *ground-truth probabilities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll focus on models that assume that classes are mutually exclusive. For example, if we're interested in determining whether an image is best described as a landscape *or* as a house *or* as something else, then our model might accept an image as input and produce three numbers as output, each representing the probability of a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we might put in an image of a landscape, and we hope that our model produces predictions that are close to the ground-truth class probabilities $y = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)^T$. If our model predicts a different distribution, say $\\hat{y} = (0.4, 0.1, 0.5)^T$, then we'd like to nudge the parameters so that $\\hat{y}$ gets closer to $y$.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need many bit sequences, one for each car model.\n",

    "How would you allocate bit sequences to the car models? Would you use the same number of bits for the Toyota Camry sequence as you would for the Tesla Model S sequence?\n",

    "No, you wouldn't. You'd allocate less bits to the Camry, because you know that you'll end up sending the Camry sequence much more often than the Tesla Model S sequence. What you're doing is exploiting your knowledge about the distribution over car models to reduce the number of bits that you need to send on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if you have access to the underlying distribution $y$, then to use the smallest number of bits on average, you should assign $\\log \\frac{1}{y_i}$ bits to the $i$-th symbol. (As a reminder, $y_i$ is the probability of the $i$-th symbol.)\n",

    "In contrast, [cross entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) is the number of bits we'll need if we encode symbols from $y$ using the *wrong* tool $\\hat{y}$. This consists of encoding the $i$-th symbol using $\\log \\frac{1}{\\hat{y}_i}$ bits instead of $\\log \\frac{1}{y_i}$ bits. We of course still take the expected value to the true distribution $y$, since it's the distribution that truly generates the symbols:\n",
