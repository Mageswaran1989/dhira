    "**High Bias** refers to a scenario where your model is “underfitting” your example dataset. This is bad because your model is not presenting a very accurate or representative picture of the relationship between your inputs and predicted output, and is often outputting high error (e.g. the difference between the model’s predicted value and actual value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Variance** represents the opposite scenario. In cases of High Variance or “overfitting”, your machine learning model is so accurate that it is perfectly fitted to your example dataset. While this may seem like a good outcome, it is also a cause for concern, as such models often fail to generalize to future datasets. So while your model works well for your existing data, you don’t know how well it’ll perform on other examples."
